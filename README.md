# TileScape
A repository for the tangible interaction-based TileScape set-up developed for tabletop games, including (1) design files to create the tabletop set-up; (2) template files to create tangible game pieces; and (3) the tracking algorithm to capture the game pieces placed on the tabletop.

## Build & Test
The design_files folder offers shape files, drawings and instructions for building TileScape or create an adapted version. It is set-up with subfolders around certain parts of the set-up, with each folder containing a readme pdf.

The code in the main folder is used to track the physical game pieces on TileScape's board. It can be initiated by creating an object of the TileScape class located in the tilescape.py file. It can be run in a test mode, which takes images from the TileScape set-up located in the input_files folder as a basis. The main call in tilescape.py currently initiates this test mode. To run it, you will need to set a local folder in line 64.
